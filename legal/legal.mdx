number and class of securities subject to the Option and the Exercise
Price shall be equitably adjusted by the Administrator, such adjustment
to be made in accordance with Section 422 of the Code to the extent
applicable.

**8. TAX OBLIGATIONS**

8.1. **Tax Withholding.** The Optionee acknowledges that, regardless of
any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Optionee's
employer (the "Employer"), the ultimate liability for all income tax,
social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account
or other tax-related items related to the Optionee's participation in
the Plan and legally applicable to the Optionee ("Tax-Related Items")
is and remains the Optionee's responsibility and may exceed the amount
actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Optionee further
acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related
Items in connection with any aspect of the Option grant, including, but
not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the
issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Option, the
subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to such
issuance and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and
are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect
of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionee's liability for
Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.

Further, if the Optionee is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one
jurisdiction, the Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or the
Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold
or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

Prior to the relevant taxable or withholdable event, as applicable, the
Optionee will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the
Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this
regard, the Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their
respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with
regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the
following:

(i) withholding from the Optionee's wages or other cash compensation
paid to the Optionee by the Company and/or the Employer;

(ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock
acquired upon exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale or
through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Optionee's
behalf pursuant to this authorization); and/or

(iii) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise
of the Option.

Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account
for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory
withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including
maximum applicable rates, in which case the Optionee will receive a
refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement
to the equivalent shares of Common Stock. If the obligation for
Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock,
for tax purposes, the Optionee is deemed to have been issued the full
number of shares of Common Stock subject to the exercised Option, notwithstanding
that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the
purposes of paying the Tax-Related Items.

Finally, the Optionee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount
of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to
withhold or account for as a result of the Optionee's participation in
the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The
Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares or the proceeds of the
sale of shares if the Optionee fails to comply with the Optionee's
obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

**9. MISCELLANEOUS**

9.1. **Plan Governs.** This Agreement is subject to all the terms and
provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more
provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the
provisions of the Plan shall govern. Capitalized terms used and not
defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.

for notices to be given to that party.

9.4. **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to principles of
conflict of laws.

9.5. **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement and the Plan constitute the

and may not be amended adversely to the Optionee's interest except by
