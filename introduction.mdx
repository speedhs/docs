## Skelsa Business Design Overview


![Skelsa Business Design Overview](image.png)

Welcome to the official documentation for **Skelsa**, a next-generation co-working space built on the principles of Biophilic Design.

Conceived by ***Sai Krishna*** (Founder at Impetus Design), Skelsa is more than a workspace—it's a bridge between people, communities, and nature. It's designed to foster well-being, creativity, and connection, with sustainability rooted at every level. We went beyond the buzzword of “biophilia” to integrate natural systems and triggers that elevate both biological and psychological responses at work.
